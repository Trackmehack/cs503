How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?
The client checks for delimiters, message length, or timeouts and handles partial reads with buffering.

This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?
A shell protocol uses delimiters or headers to mark commands, and without this, data can be split or combined wrong.

Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.
The general differences between stateful and stateless protocols are that stateful protocols remember past data, while stateless ones treat each request separately.

Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?
We would use it because UDP is fast and good for streaming, gaming, and DNS, even if some data is lost.
